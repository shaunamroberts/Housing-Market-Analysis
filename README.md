# Housing-Market-Analysis
New York Housing Market Analysis Enhancement
Expanded on Ayo Bankole’s original research analyzing the New York Housing Market dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. The initial analysis explored property types, pricing trends, and geographical distributions through descriptive statistics and visualizations, including bar graphs, line plots, and geospatial mapping.

Enhancements included refining data analysis for specific regions, particularly Brooklyn, to gain localized insights. Addressed data quality issues by identifying and managing outliers for more accurate trend representation. Investigated the “pending” housing category to analyze its distribution and compare it with sold properties, providing insights into market trends and potential price shifts. Improved visualization techniques by refining geospatial maps, incorporating customized marker colors based on property type and price range, adding labels, and utilizing clustering for better readability in high-density areas.

This project demonstrates expertise in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive actionable insights from large datasets in real estate market analysis
